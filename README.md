# Bike Sharing Assignment
> This project was built as part of Linear Regression module assignment during the course of AI/ML by IIIT-B and Upgrad.


## Contents of Repository

1. Dataset - day.csv actual dataset used for the assignment.
2. Python Notebook - Which contains the bike sharing linear regression assignment.
3. PDF File - Which contains the assignment based and general questions subjective questions answered.
4. Readme.txt - Metadata of the dataset.

## General Information
- This project was built as part of Linear Regression module assignment during the course of AI/ML by IIIT-B and Upgrad.
- What is the background of your project? - It is based out on a case study for understanding linear regression concepts and implement it practically.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? - A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. During the covid the company was impacted and business has been shut for quite some time. It has data of 2018 and 2019 during which it was operational. The company wants us to study that dataset and derive valuable insights and relationships out of it so that it can devise it's strategy for the markey and gain maximum profits.
- What is the dataset that is being used? - day.csv file which contains the dataset of previous bike bookings count during the period of 2018 and 2019.


## Conclusions

Top features which contributed significantly towards demand of shared bikes are :
- Temp (coefficient value = 0.5804)
- Weather Situation 3 (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds) (coefficient value = -0.2768)
- Season 4 (winter season) (coefficient value = 0.1291)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
